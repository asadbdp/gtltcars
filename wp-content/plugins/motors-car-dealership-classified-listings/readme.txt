### How This Auto Listing Wordpress Plugin Works

This plugin gives you a basic template to work with; however, you are free to customize it using the general settings. You will be able to setup the most vital aspects according to your preferences, including the listing archive, prices and positions, and the price delimiter. 

As a car trader, you’ll find this **dealer inventory plugin** offers several options that make it easy for you to showcase your supply. You can easily add listing pages, include photos, and enable users to contribute changes prior to posting. This feature makes it easy for you to appoint additional administrators to assist you with filling your site with the newest vehicles available for sale. 

Specify vehicle bodies, add makes and models, and designate fuel types for each of your listings. Having all the information upfront lessens inquiry calls, empowers buyers to make an informed purchase, and helps to move your inventory along.

You’ll also be able to add videos and images to the gallery so your customers can take a good look at your vehicles prior to purchase.

With this ease of use, your customers will get to enjoy a customized experience that allows them to focus on only the models and features they are looking for. Instead of spending endless hours clicking through “next” buttons just to find the car of their dreams. 

Each listing allows you to track how many views are coming through, giving you feedback that encourages you to refine each listing. For instance, if you notice one of your listings has many more views than others, you can more carefully configure the others to match your most popular listing and increase views throughout your site.
